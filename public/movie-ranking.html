<h1>JC's 2025 Movie Tracker</h1>

<p>Hi readers, here is my movie tracker for 2025. So far, I already have 3 movies in my bag this year and I'm hoping to watch more.</p>

<h2>Here are the 3 movies that I've watched so far *drum roll*</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>Nosferatu</h3>
<p>The plot was great and the actors were great but the highlight for me was the fuckin cinematography, such a masterpiece. and I heard it was nominated for several Oscar awards too!</p>

<h3>Minecraft Movie</h3>
<p>This movie was nice and the actors were great as well, I also liked that they paid tribute to the late Technoblade<i>(rest in piece king!)</i></p>

<h3>Snowhite</h3>
<p>The highlight of the movie was Rachel Zegler only and not Lil Ms. Zionist Gal Gadot. </p>
